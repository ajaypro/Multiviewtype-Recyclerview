# Multiviewtype-Recyclerview

* Very simple multiviewtype recyclerview with header and footer
* I have created a ktlint.gradle file in which I have defined two gradle tasks to verify and format kotlin code which removes
 unused imports and other formating as well. 
* To use this commet out the `apply from: 'ktlint.gradle'` from app.gradle file and run gradle tasks under formatting `ktlintFormat` and 
 for verification `ktlint`
